# csta.dev - Static site builder

This repository includes the content for my site [https://csta.dev](https://csta.dev) which is a Go builder app that renders [Templ](https://templ.guide) templates and Markdown blog posts into a static Github Pages deployment.

If you'd like to see how it works, clone the repo and run `make help` for more information.
